This project spans VR, sculpture, and wearable design, originating from a Newton–Leipnik strange-attractor equation I evolved into a 3D lifeform. In Unreal Engine, I built a VR world inhabited by these monumental creatures—rib-like corridors and open mouths forming a hive-like biome with no fixed ground. At our school exhibition, visitors described the experience as “beautifully unsettling,” often losing orientation and bodily boundaries.
I later 3D-printed the creature, hand-finished it with metallic pigments, and adapted it into a performative headpiece, sparking my research into digital fashion—parametric garments generated from mathematical and architectural systems—presented in a digital runway with process documentation.
The project culminated in a collaboration with filmmaker Leon Lin on Pseudosynthesis, exploring how motion capture and emotional improvisation translate movement into shifting digital identities.
